ClonicOptics Video Capture
===============
Easy capture of seamlessly looping GIF from analog video sources (modular video synthesizers, security cameras, etc).

Worklfow:

1. Capture 7 seconds of video.
2. Adjust parameters:
  - Start point
  - Stop point
  - Number of frames
  - Playback speed
3. Export/upload!

Gif files are to tumblr's spec (as of July 2014):
- less than 500px wide (default 320x240 aka half NTSC)
- less than 900k (they claim a meg but support is spotty)
- less than 80 frames

Moonshot is to get it hooked up to a midi knob box using [jazz plugin](http://http://jazz-soft.net/) like the [vcovault tutorial](http://vcovault.com/midi-mapping-javascript/) for keyboard & mouseless capture.

Would also be nice to preserve original image sequences / or hq video for later upload to videopong/vine/ig/etc.
